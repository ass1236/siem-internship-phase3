🎯 Objective
To detect lateral movement in a Windows environment using RDP brute-force attacks with stolen credentials. This is a common post-exploitation technique observed in real-world breaches. This scenario uses a combination of failed RDP login attempts and a subsequent successful RDP logon to raise a high-confidence alert.

🛠️ Requirements and Configuration
✅ Enable Audit Policy for Logon Events
Enable logging of both success and failure logons:

bash
Copy
Edit
AuditPol /set /subcategory:"Logon" /success:enable /failure:enable
This is needed to generate:

1- 4625 – Failed RDP login
2- 4624 – Successful login
** Wazuh rule 92657 maps to successful RDP logon with possible pass-the-hash detection.


🔐  Simulate RDP Brute Force
On a Linux attacker machine, use Hydra:
--> hydra -t 4 -V -f -l username -P passwords.txt rdp://192.168.X.X

✅ Verifying Detection
You should see Wazuh alerts like:

** 100401 – Single RDP failed login.
** 100402 – Brute-force activity due to multiple failures.
** 100403 – High-level alert indicating possible lateral movement via RDP.

✅ Conclusion
This simulation demonstrated how to detect lateral movement via RDP brute-force attacks using a combination of Wazuh built-in rules and custom correlation logic. By leveraging Windows Security Events (4625 for failed logon and the built-in rule 92657 for successful remote logon), we built a multi-stage detection that escalates in severity based on attacker behavior:

** Initial brute-force attempts are detected through repeated RDP login failures.
** A successful remote login following those failures increases the confidence of malicious activity.
** The final alert suggests possible lateral movement, which is a key phase in real-world attacks.
