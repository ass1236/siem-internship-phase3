🎯 Objective: 
Detect a persistence technique where a PowerShell script is configured to run at user logon by modifying the HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run registry key.

🛠️ Environment Setup
1- Victim machine: Windows 10 with Wazuh agent and Sysmon installed
2- SIEM: Wazuh Manager on Kali Linux
3- MITRE Technique: T1547.001 – Registry Run Keys / Startup Folder

🔸 Attack Simulation Steps
1. Create a PowerShell Script
Create a test script that represents the payload to persist:
echo "Start-Sleep -Seconds 30; Write-Output 'Persistence Test'" > C:\Users\windows\Documents\test.ps1

2. Add Persistence via Registry
Use reg.exe to add a new Run key entry that executes the script at user logon:
reg add HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run /v TestPersistence /t REG_SZ /d "powershell.exe -WindowStyle Hidden -File C:\Users\windows\Documents\test.ps1"
This command sets up persistence by instructing Windows to run the script silently every time the user logs in.

📦 Detection in Wazuh
✅ Built-in Detection
Wazuh includes a built-in rule that detects modifications to registry keys related to persistence.

 ** Rule ID: 92302
 ** Event Source: Sysmon Event ID 13
 ** Condition: Registry value set under CurrentVersion\Run using reg.exe
 ** MITRE Mapping: T1547.001

This rule was triggered successfully during the test and recorded all relevant information including:
 ** Registry path modified
 ** Value details (payload)
 ** Executing process (reg.exe)
 ** User context
 ** Parent-child relationship (PowerShell → reg.exe)

 Custom Detection Rule
A custom rule was added to wrap the built-in rule with enhanced visibility and labeling:

<group name="custom,persistence,registry">
  <rule id="100201" level="12">
    <if_sid>92302</if_sid>
    <description>Custom Alert: Registry persistence technique detected (Run key modified)</description>
    <mitre>
      <id>T1547.001</id>
      <tactic>Persistence</tactic>
      <technique>Registry Run Keys / Startup Folder</technique>
    </mitre>
  </rule>
</group>
--> File path: /var/ossec/etc/rules/local_rules.xml

✅ Conclusion
This simulation successfully demonstrated how attackers can establish persistence by modifying the Windows registry Run key to execute a malicious or scheduled script at user logon — a technique well-documented under MITRE ATT&CK T1547.001.
Using Sysmon Event ID 13 and Wazuh’s built-in rule 92302, along with a custom correlation rule (100201), we were able to detect this activity in real-time.
